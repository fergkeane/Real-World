   Skytek Design System — Living Changelog data
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This file is the single source of truth for the Changelog page.

   APPEND PROTOCOL (read before editing):
   • Whenever ANY part of the design system changes — a component, pattern,
     token, doc, accessibility rule, brand element or asset — add a NEW entry
     object to the TOP of the CHANGELOG_ENTRIES array below.
   • Never edit or delete past entries. The changelog is an immutable record.
   • Fill every field. Use the current date/time in UTC.
   • Version numbers follow semver and increment from the previous entry:
        – Breaking            → bump MAJOR (x.0.0)
        – Minor (new feature) → bump MINOR (1.x.0)
        – Patch / fix         → bump PATCH (1.2.x)
        – Documentation Only  → bump PATCH
   • Category MUST be one of:
        Component | Pattern | Token | Documentation |
        Accessibility | Brand | Asset | Other
   • Impact MUST be one of:
        Breaking | Minor | Patch | Documentation Only
